-----------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 41 will be all contained within one class, App.
App will consist of four functions.

The program's objective is to take in a text file as input,
store all lines as separate strings called "names", then
sort them alphabetically, and prints them to an output text
file.

pseudocode:

App {
    void main ()
        // configures input and output text files
        // runs other functions
        // stores key variables

    ArrayList<String> createNameList (Scanner)
        // reads each line from the scanner input
        // stores each line as a string in an arraylist
        // sorts name list using sortNameList function

    ArrayList<String> sortNameList (ArrayList<String>)
        // takes in list of strings and sorts them

    void outputNameList(ArrayList<String>, FileWriter)
        // takes in list of strings and filewriter
        // formats output and writes entire arraylist
}
