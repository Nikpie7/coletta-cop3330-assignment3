-----------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 43 will be all contained within two classes, App
and Website.

The program's objective is to generate a basic website taking
in the user's input as basic parameters for the website. All
the website's information will be stored in an instance of
the class, Website, and the output will be completed from a
function within this instance.

pseudocode:

App {
    void main ()
        //creates the website using the function below
        //generates output using the Website function

    Website getWebsite(Scanner scan)
        //takes in the user input through a scanner
        //creates a website object from the scanner
}

Website {
    //holds private variables for the site name, author, js folder, and css folder

    Website(String site, String author, boolean js, boolean css)
        //takes in parameters above and stores locally

    //all the following functions return the respective value for the website- used for unit testing.
    String getSite()
    String getAuthor()
    boolean getJSS()
    boolean getCSS()

    void generateOutput()
        //using the private variables, creates the appropriate directories and files
}
