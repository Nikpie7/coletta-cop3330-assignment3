-----------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 44 will be all contained within one class, App, which
contains five functions

The program's objective is to take in a text file as input, store
each line into an arrayList of strings, ask the user for the output
file name, and then change all instances of "utilize" in the file
to "use", and finally output the result into a text file.

pseudocode:

App {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
        //reads in the input file
        //stores local variables
        //runs other methods

    public static ArrayList<String> createList(Scanner scan)
        //creates an arraylist from all lines of a scanner
        //returns created arraylist

    public static String getFileName(Scanner scan)
        //prompts user for the filename
        //returns received filename

    public static ArrayList<String> replaceUtilize(ArrayList<String> input)
        //goes through entire arraylist and replaces each "utilize" with "use"
        //returns adjusted arraylist

    public static void writeList(FileWriter output, ArrayList<String> text) throws IOException
        //outputs the arraylist of strings to the fileWriter
}
