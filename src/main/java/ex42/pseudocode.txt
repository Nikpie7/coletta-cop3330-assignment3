Exercise 42 will be all contained within two classes, App and Person.

The program's objective is to take in a text file as input,
take in line inputs and separate it out and store each piece of
data in their respective location. Then, the data is printed in an
organized table.

pseudocode:

App {
    main()
        //creates person arraylist
        //holds io file variables
        //calls functions to output

    ArrayList<Person> createPersonArray(Scanner scan)
        //takes in scanner and creates a person per line of input
        //stores all person instances in an arraylist

    printPersonArray(ArrayList<Person> P)
        //formats all persons in the arraylist in a table
}

Person {
    //holds private variables for firstname, lastname, and salary

    Person(String first, String last, int Salary)
        // constructs person object, takes in data to be stored in each instance

    String getFirst()
        //getter function returns firstname of person

    String getLast()
        //getter function returns lastname of person

    int getSalary()
        //getter function returns salary of person

}
