Exercise 46 will be all contained within two classes, App and
StringCounter

The program's objective is to take in a text file as input, store
each unique word as a StringCounter object, and track the number
of times each word repeated. Then, it will output the frequency data
in a sorted histogram.

pseudocode:

App {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
        //reads in the input file
        //stores local variables
        //runs other methods

    ArrayList<StringCounter> createList(Scanner scan)
        //creates a StringCounter ArrayList from each line of the input
        //returns created ArrayList

    void printFrequencies(ArrayList<StringCounter> strList)
        //takes in StringCounter ArrayList and prints it into a histogram
        //output is formatted
        //StringCounter's are printed from the greatest frequency to least frequent;
        //calls printStars to print the quantities

    void printStars(int num)
        //recursive function that prints out a "*" symbol for each num
}

StringCounter {
    //stores local private variables for a string, and a counter

    public StringCounter(String str)
        //basic constructor setting str to the local string
        //sets the counter to 1 be default

    //the following are getter and setter variables for controlling local variables
    String getStr()
    int getCount()
    void setStr(String str)
    void setCount(int count)
}
